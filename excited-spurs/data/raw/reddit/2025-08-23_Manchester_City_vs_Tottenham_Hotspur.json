I think he'll set us up quite like the City game for this occasion: \n\n* Back 5 picks itself, although Udogie will happily rotate in when fit. He might get 20 mins here.\n* Midfield: I think you've got to keep Sarr and Palhinha given their form. Palhinha is a tone setter. We might have more of the ball in this game, but having Palhinha as a warden shutting down any Bournemouth counters or attacks will be crucial in our spine. Sarr probably has to start - his form and work ethic is too good at the moment.\n* Other midfield spot - I love seeing Bentancur return to form, but I'd love to see Bergvall in. I really think Bergvall could ",

      "body": "I know we were 0-2 up by half time at the Etihad last season, but it felt like a very chaotic game where they could have beat us on a different day. We created a boat load of chances, but so did they (albeit less than we did). 0-4 was more a reflection of how profligate they were than anything. 3-4 probably would have been a fairer scoreline for that game.\n\nThis feels much more controlled. We've kept them out really well, and it doesn't feel like the outcome could be anything other than what it is atm. Ironically, I was going to comment on Richy's struggles holding the ball up. As it turns out, he's grown into the game and contributed really well. He's done a good job at forcing high turnovers and slipping away from the CB's. \n\nLastly, I love Johnson so much. He genuinely might be one of the funniest players we've ever had. He can pop up with a goal at any time, despite being completely invisible for most of the half. Lovely finish today. He's such a useful profile to have in the squad",
