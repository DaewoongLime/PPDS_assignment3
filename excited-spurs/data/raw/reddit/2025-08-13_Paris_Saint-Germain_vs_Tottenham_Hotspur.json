If anything, your point 3 suggests the opposite - with the caveat that top-line xG can be misleading because by definition it does not disaggregate, e.g, npXG, etc.\n\nFWIW, every time somebody posts xGPhilosophy or any other single-game xG metric following a match that includes a penalty, there is invariably a comment that the xG includes the pen - to the point that I think it's common knowledge and widely understood.\n\nSo if the proposal here is simply: any post-match xG post should be required to include sub-metrics for context, I wouldn't be opposed to that.

No one is going to tell me otherwise, that's how I like to use the statistic. I know game state is a factor here, as well as it is a factor when purely looking at shots taken. xG doesn't even consider the quality of chance provided when a shot isn't taken, there are other flaws but it doesn't mean it's not useful. \n\nI'm waffling but my point is people should be able to discuss and use the stats as they wish. Otherwise we will be banning the sharing of shots on target etc in case it's taken out of context.\n\nLet's continue to promote open discussion without unnecessary policing.
