Xavi helped a bit but he looked a little jaded by the frantic pace of play at the end where it's less system based, but that's the PL for ya.\n\nIn the end, some good fight, stayed patient, got back into it. Brighton are a good side, beat City also recently, so away to them is a well-earned point. Roll on to the next one and continue building cohesion.\n\n\nSide note, I'm sorry, but Johnson is comprised of 95% useless, 5% finishing. He offers little to nothing defensively, hold up, interplay, creativity. It's just brutal to watch and actually hurt Xavi's effectiveness to a point. We need a LW and although Odobert wasn't very effective, he at least felt present, like we had someone over there.",
